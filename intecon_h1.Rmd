# Prompt

The goal is to replicate Redding and Venables (2004) regressions and graphs for a recent set of years. The
dataset is an updated version of the one in Head and Mayer (2011), with international trade only (no self
trade), so that the Foreign Market Potential (FMP) can be calculated.

a. Calculate FMP of each country in 2016 and regress it on GDP per capita (in log-log)

b. Replicate the exercise with all years since 2004. Which fixed effects can you now
introduce in the second step? does it change results ?

# a. Calculate FMP of each country in 2016 and regress it on GDP per capita (in log-log)
